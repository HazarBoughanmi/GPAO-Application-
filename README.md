1-Project Description:

 To manufacture long-term solar power (SPS) satellites. Our company conducts research and tests on photovoltaic cells/panels in order to optimize them in terms of mass, resistance and geometry.
SPS-NH offers two different models in its catalogue:

-solar cells. (Semi-finished product that can be sold)
-one module has 60 photovoltaic cells.

You can see more deatails, about products, ressource ..in the file ""Description de SPS-NH.docx""



2-Project Implementation:


An integrated management software package or ERP  is a software package which allows "to manage all the processes of a company by integrating all of its functions, including human resources management, accounting and financial management, decision support, but also sales, distribution, procurement and electronic commerce ”

In purpose to develop more our project and guide it to industry 4.0, we develop the front end of an application called "Saisie de la production" inorded to digitilasing tasks of our supervisors and operators, all of these described well in part2 which is come into collaboration INSAT-WYNSYS

**********************************Part2*********************************

 3-Digital Manufacturing application

Our application  allows companies to join this spectacular form of digital revolution that  is living today’s industry: digital transformation and move towards a paperless environment (zero paper). 
We are gradually moving towards the factory of the future, with digitized processes, more and more computerized data processing and exchange

So Our application caracteristics:

-Enter the operations performed, the resources used and the associated components By the operator

-Facilitate the control of the supervisor toward his employees 

-Less working time by eliminating paper use

-Trace time consumed by the supervisor: the duration of the operation, the start and end dates, the time missing to prepare the necessary resources

step1:Bizagi Modelling 

we modelled the whole flow between actors, with Bizagi software ,you can download it and see more information about this software by visiting this link,
https://www.bizagi.com/en/platform/modeler , but you should sign up first. 
 
You can download our model, or see it, in pdf format, download "Bizagi Model" folder 

step2: Build Me, Front End 

We accomplish  the front end of our application  using build.me , sign up and visit our application by visiting this link https://standard.build.me/prototype-editors/api/public/v2/prototypes/60a7bfdea4b7457fc12bbcfc/snapshots/latest/artifacts/index.html#/Operateur and you can take look in the folder " database",In order to understand more how it works.




I hope I have helped you, if anything is not clear or you would like to ask about more information you can find me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/boughanmihazar/
