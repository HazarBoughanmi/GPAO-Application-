###GPAO project and Digital Manufacturing application


Hello All, 
***********************************Part1******************************
1-Project Description:
 To manufacture long-term solar power (SPS) satellites. Our company conducts research and tests on photovoltaic cells/panels in order to optimize them in terms of mass, resistance and geometry.
SPS-NH offers two different models in its catalogue:

-solar cells. (Semi-finished product that can be sold)
-one module has 60 photovoltaic cells.

You can see more deatails, about products, ressource ..in the file 



2-Project Implementation:
An integrated management software package or ERP  is a software package which allows "to manage all the processes of a company by integrating all of its functions, including human resources management, accounting and financial management, decision support, but also sales, distribution, procurement and electronic commerce ” 

In our project we used , prelude software  , u can install it and see more about it by visiting this site http://cipe-prelude.net/Francais/ 
After you have installed prelude , u can download the folder , application ,where you can  find all the steps of implemenation , and yes , this is our virtuall SPS entreprise. 

In purpose to develop more our project and guide it to industry 4.0, we develop the front end of an application called "Saisie de la production" inorded to digitilasing tasks of our supervisors and operators, all of these described well in part2 which is come into collaboration INSAT-WYNSYS

**********************************Part2*********************************
Our app allows companies to join this spectacular form of digital revolution that  is living today’s industry: digital transformation and move towards a paperless environment (zero paper). 
We are gradually moving towards the factory of the future, with digitized processes, more and more computerized data processing and exchange

So Our application caracteristics:

-Enter the operations performed, the resources used and the associated components By the operator

-Facilate the controle by the supervisor toward his employess 

-less display time by eliminate paper use

-Trace time consumedby the supervisor: the duration of the operation, the start and end dates, the time lost to prepare the necessary resources

step1:

we modelated the haull flow between actors ,with Bizagi  u can downlod it and see more information about this software by visiting this link,

https://www.bizagi.com/en/platform/modeler , but u should sign up first. 
 
You  can download our model , or see in pdf format exist in bizagi folder

step2:
We do the front end of our application  using build.me , sign up and visit our apllication by visiting this link 




I hope i heleped , if anything is not clear or u would like to ask about more information u can find me on likedin
